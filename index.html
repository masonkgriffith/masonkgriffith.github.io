    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I started in tech and never looked back.
    </p>

    <p>
        In high school, I spent a lot of time gaming on console and wanted to level up to a gaming PC. 
        On a tight budget and unable to afford prebuilt systems, I stepped outside my comfort zone 
        and built my own. That decision sparked my passion for technology and problem-solving.
    </p>

    <p>
        I quickly became the go-to “IT” person for friends and family, which led to me starting 
        my career as a Help Desk Technician right out of high school. My natural curiosity pushed 
        me to go deeper than basic support, and that’s when I discovered network engineering — and I was hooked.
    </p>

    <p>
        With mentorship from a network administrator early in my career, I pursued and earned my 
        Network+ and CCNA certifications. Since then, I’ve focused on building real-world lab 
        environments that mirror enterprise networks — working with firewalls, segmentation, 
        secure service publishing, and hybrid cloud security.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, I continue sharpening my skills through hands-on labs and studying advanced networking 
        and cloud technologies. I also enjoy mentoring others — helping friends with no direction 
        break into IT and build careers of their own.
